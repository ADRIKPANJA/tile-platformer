# Altough its not completed, you can still use it.
- To install my project, click on Code <> button on top right, and click download zip.
- Now extract the zip and cd into that folder in a cammand shell.
- Once you cd into that, run this
```Bash
python Run_Game.py
```
- If it errors, try this
```Bash
python3 Run_Game.py
```
- If it still errors, make sure that you have Python 3.12 or above installed.
