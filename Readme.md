# Altough its not completed, you can still use it.
- To install my project, click on `Code <>` button on top right, and click `download zip`.
- Now extract the `zip` and `cd` into that folder in a `cammand shell`.
- Once you `cd` into that, run this
```Bash
python Run_Game.py
```
- If it errors, try this
```Bash
python3 Run_Game.py
```
- If it still errors, make sure that you have `Python 3.12` or above installed.

> **Note:** If you are on linux and you tried all of the steps to run the project but still errors, make sure you have a venv activated. This can be done by using `python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate` in your `bash shell`.

> **CAUTION** Modifying the project's `.py` files can break it!
